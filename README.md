#  ARC WARS
Turn-based strategy game inspired by *Advance Wars*, built in **Unity**.


##  About the Game
ARC Wars is a **turn-based tactical strategy game** where players command armies on a grid-based map.  
Each player controls units such as Infantry, Tanks, Artillery, and Helicopters, competing to capture buildings, earn gold, and eliminate enemies.  

Players must balance **strategy** (resource management, positioning, and capturing) with **tactics** (choosing which units to move or attack).  
The game supports multiple modes, **2P**, **3P**, and **4P** with different maps for each.


##  How to Play

###  Objective
Capture your opponent’s HQ or eliminate all enemy units to win the match.

###  Turn Order
- Players take turns controlling their units.
- Each turn, a player can **move**, **attack**, or **capture** with any unit that hasn’t acted yet.

###  Combat
- Click a unit to select it.
- Click a nearby enemy to attack (must be within attack range).
- Attacks reduce enemy HP depending on unit type and strength.

###  Capturing
- Infantry units can capture neutral or enemy buildings.
- Capturing generates **gold** each turn, which can be used to buy new units from factories.

###  Buying Units
